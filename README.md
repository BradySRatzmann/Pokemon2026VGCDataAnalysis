#Pokémon Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes competitive Pokémon team data to compute usage statistics, synergy scores, partner frequency, and other analytical metrics. It supports extracting teams from Poképaste links, organizing them into structured datasets, running statistical analysis, and generating visualizations.

The project is designed to help players, analysts, and researchers understand which Pokémon combinations appear most often and how frequently they are used in tournament-level play.

To Run:
    python main.py (to switch currently used dataset change line 599 from "data_points = read_data("data.txt")" ---> "data_points = read_data("filename.txt")" it is configured for data.txt by default)
